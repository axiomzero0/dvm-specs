**Related Sections:** `ir_spec.md`, `effect_system.md`, `abi.md`, `bytecode_spec.md`, `guest_language_profiles.md`, `runtime_contracts.md`

This document is the authoritative, uncompressed transcription of the laws that
govern the DVM compiler and runtime. **Every commit to the `compiler/`,
`runtime/`, `tools/`, and `tests/` trees must comply. CI verifies them. There are
no exceptions.**

---

## Part 0: Multi-Language Guest Contract

DVM is a **dynamic virtual machine** designed to execute multiple guest
languages through a common compiler and runtime infrastructure.

DVM is not a single-language virtual machine. Therefore, the compiler and
runtime must never encode the semantics of one guest language directly into
core optimization passes, IR invariants, backend lowering, or runtime fast
paths unless those semantics are explicitly exposed through a Guest Language
Profile.

Every supported language must target DVM through the following contract:

1. **DVM Portable Bytecode**  
   A typed, register-based, effect-carrying bytecode format that can be
   validated, profiled, interpreted, baseline-compiled, and optimized.

2. **Guest Language Profile**  
   A versioned description of the language’s semantics, object model, memory
   model, exception model, dynamic features, native interop rules, and
   observability requirements.

3. **Guest Semantic Oracle**  
   A reference implementation, reference test suite, or formally specified
   behavioral model against which DVM can be compared for semantic fidelity.

4. **Runtime Capability Declarations**  
   Explicit declarations of which dynamic, reflective, numeric, concurrency,
   debugging, and memory-management features the guest language supports.

The DVM core compiler must remain language-agnostic. All language-specific
semantics must be expressed through:

- Guest Language Profiles
- capability flags
- effect classes
- dependency records
- lowering hooks
- runtime helpers
- verifier constraints
- test matrices

If a guest language feature cannot be represented safely in DVM IR, the frontend
must lower that feature conservatively or mark it opaque. The runtime must then
execute it through a lower tier or through approved runtime helpers.

### Guest Language Profile Requirements

Each Guest Language Profile must define, at minimum:

- language name
- language version
- dialect/version hash
- bytecode format version
- object header layout
- object shape/version model
- type/class/model versioning rules
- module/import semantics
- global/module/builtin namespace semantics
- exception model
- stack trace model
- numeric semantics
- operator overload or dispatch-hook semantics
- dynamic member/property access semantics
- reflection/introspection capabilities
- frame introspection capabilities
- debugging/profiling/tracing hooks
- weak-reference model
- finalization model
- memory management model
- identity semantics
- native/FFI model
- concurrency/threading model
- suspension model, if any
- static certification rules, if any

### Guest Capability Flags

Guest Language Profiles must declare capability flags such as:

- `HasDynamicCodeEvaluation`
- `HasDynamicCompilation`
- `HasDynamicImports`
- `HasDynamicMemberMutation`
- `HasOpenClasses`
- `HasMonkeyPatching`
- `HasFrameIntrospection`
- `HasWeakReferences`
- `HasFinalizers`
- `HasIdentityAddressObservation`
- `HasReferenceCountIntrospection`
- `HasMovingGC`
- `HasResumableFunctions`
- `HasGenerators`
- `HasCoroutines`
- `HasAsyncFunctions`
- `HasFibers`
- `HasContinuations`
- `HasOperatorOverloading`
- `HasDynamicDispatch`
- `HasModuleReloading`
- `HasFFI`
- `HasGlobalRuntimeLock`
- `HasFreeThreading`
- `HasTracingHooks`
- `HasProfilerHooks`
- `HasDebuggerHooks`
- `HasStaticCertification`

If a capability is absent, the compiler must not assume the feature exists.
If a capability is present, the compiler must preserve its observable semantics.

---

## Part I: Architectural Overview

The DVM execution model consists of four distinct, seamlessly integrated
execution tiers. Transitions between tiers are governed by profile data and
static guarantees, never by arbitrary timeouts.

1. **Tier 0: Direct-Threaded Register Interpreter**  
   The baseline execution engine. Uses computed gotos and a register-based
   bytecode representation, not a stack-based representation, to minimize
   dispatch overhead. This tier provides fast startup, minimal memory footprint,
   full guest-language semantic fidelity, and the ultimate fallback for all
   guest code.

2. **Tier 1: Baseline JIT**  
   Triggered by low-level heat, such as loop backedges or function invocation
   counts. Compiles in linear time. Performs basic type specialization, copy
   propagation, simple inlining, and lightweight guard insertion. Compilation
   time is strictly bounded to prevent mutator stalls.

3. **Tier 2: Optimizing JIT**  
   Triggered by sustained heat and rich PGO data. Employs the full DVM
   optimization pipeline. Performs aggressive speculative optimizations such as
   partial escape analysis, scalar replacement, guard-based devirtualization,
   SLP vectorization, and speculative effect reordering where legal. Requires
   full `FrameState` and deoptimization infrastructure.

4. **Tier 3: AOT / Static JIT**  
   Applied to code with provable static guarantees. Examples include sealed
   types, final declarations, isolated modules, fully annotated code, absence of
   dynamic introspection, and mechanically verified static constraints. Bypasses
   speculation and deoptimization overhead entirely where permitted. Maximum
   optimization, zero guard checks, direct native code emission.

---

## Part II: The Unified Pipeline & Speculation Laws

**Rule 1 — One Pipeline, Multiple Inputs**  
The IR, pass interfaces, verifier constraints, and correctness constraints are
**unified** across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tiers differ only by budgets,
enabled speculation policies, available proofs, guest language capabilities,
and telemetry requirements.

- **Tier 1 Input:** Static IR + Minimal Heuristics + Guest Language Profile.
- **Tier 2 Input:** Static IR + PGO Data + Guest Language Profile.
- **Tier 3 Input:** Static IR + Static Proofs + Guest Language Profile Certification.

There is no “JIT-only” pass list. Forcing the exact same pass sequence can
waste compile time in Tier 1 or prevent legitimate tier-specific lowering. If a
pass exists, it must handle all modes via a unified interface, but the pipeline
may apply tier-specific filters.

**Rule 2 — PGO is a Force Multiplier, Not New Logic**  
PGO data does not change *what* the compiler does; it changes *how aggressively*
it does it.

Example: a speculative effect-reordering pass may be conceptually available in
all tiers. In Tier 3, it requires static proof. In Tier 2, it accepts
high-confidence PGO and inserts a guard. In Tier 1, it is skipped due to
budget.

PGO must never introduce new semantic behavior. It only enables or disables
optimizations that are already semantically legal under guard or proof.

**Rule 3 — Every PGO-Driven Decision Requires a Guard**  
If a pass makes a decision based on PGO, it **must** emit a validated guard
mechanism: runtime check, shape/version guard, patchpoint, trap, dependency
invalidation, hardware check, or another approved validation mechanism.

Examples of PGO-driven decisions include:

- pointers A and B never alias
- this container lookup is monomorphic
- this call site has one dominant receiver type
- this integer value remains in range
- this object layout is stable
- this branch is almost always taken
- this function is usually called with a specific signature
- this exception path is cold

Guard success executes the optimized path. Guard failure triggers
deoptimization or fallback.

**Rule 4 — Deoptimization Must Reconstruct Tier 0 State**  
When a JIT guard fails, the runtime must deoptimize to the **exact same state**
the Tier 0 Direct-Threaded Register Interpreter would have been in at that
instruction position.

This includes:

- restoring register values
- re-materializing guest frames
- restoring local variables
- restoring closure cells
- restoring exception state
- restoring tracing/monitoring state
- restoring guest-visible memory effects
- restoring reference-management state where observable
- rolling back or compensating speculatively reordered effects only where legal

Speculative execution must not perform irreversible guest-visible side effects
before the last guard protecting that speculation. If side effects are moved,
they must be either proven non-observable, deferred until committed, or
supported by a verified compensation mechanism.

“Rolling back memory writes” is dangerous if guest-visible effects already
happened. Therefore, speculative side effects are governed by Rule 85.

**Rule 5 — FrameState is Mandatory for All Guards**  
Every node that introduces a speculative assumption must have a `FrameState`
attachment. This snapshot allows the deoptimizer to rebuild the guest language
execution world if the speculation fails.

`FrameState` must include enough information to reconstruct the guest-visible
state required by the Guest Language Profile, including but not limited to:

- bytecode offset
- source position
- local variables
- closure cells
- free variables
- global/module namespace version
- builtin/runtime library version
- exception state
- tracing/profiling state
- suspension state where applicable
- reference-management state where observable

---

## Part III: Compilation Pipeline & Memory Laws

**Rule 6 — NO EXCEPTIONS ON THE HOT PATH**  
Native C++ exceptions are forbidden on compiler/runtime hot paths. The JIT
compiler, AOT compiler, and Runtime Deoptimization engine **MUST** be compiled
with `-fno-exceptions`. Zero `throw` statements are allowed in any code path
executed during compilation or runtime specialization.

All fallible operations **MUST** use `std::expected<T, Diagnostic>` or
`Result<T, Error>`.

Guest-language exceptions remain first-class runtime values and must be modeled
explicitly. Do not confuse guest exceptions with C++ exceptions. If a JIT
compilation fails, it returns an `Error` variant, causing the system to
silently fall back to Tier 0 or Tier 1. No stack unwinding. No catch blocks.
No overhead.

**Rule 7 — Zero-Allocation Hot Path**  
Both AOT and JIT compilers must use `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource` for
IR allocation. Bulk-free after compilation. No `malloc`/`free` in the compiler
hot path.

“Hot path” means: compiler pass execution, guard execution, inline-cache fast
paths, allocation fast paths, and deopt entry trampolines. Deopt
materialization may allocate only through a controlled runtime path with
explicit budgets — deopt may legitimately need to materialize objects.

**Rule 8 — No RTTI**  
Both pipelines are compiled with `-fno-rtti`. Use `enum class NodeKind` for
type switching. RTTI is forbidden in the IR and backend to ensure maximum
devirtualization and cache locality.

**Rule 9 — No `std::shared_ptr` / `std::function` in Hot IR Code**  
They allocate and incur atomic overhead. Use raw pointers plus stable `NodeId`s
inside passes.

**Rule 10 — Every Pass Must Be Idempotent and Monotonic**  
Running the same pass twice must produce the identical IR. A pass either
reduces node count or moves the IR closer to a normal form. If a pass can grow
the IR, such as Loop Unrolling or SLP Vectorization, it must run inside a
guarded fixpoint with a strict budget.

**Rule 11 — Mutator Threads Never Block on JIT**  
If a function becomes “hot” and triggers a JIT compilation, the mutator thread
continues executing the current tier. The JIT runs asynchronously on a
background compiler thread. Once ready, a safe-point patch swaps the function
pointer. Function pointer publication must be atomic and safe against
concurrent execution. Old code must remain valid until quiescence — a
safe-point patch is not enough if publication is torn or old code is freed too
early.

**Rule 12 — Thread-Local Allocation for Mutators**  
Mutator threads use thread-local bump pointers, lexical regions, or equivalent
thread-local allocation mechanisms for their own runtime allocations where the
guest memory model permits. Global synchronization happens only at explicit
yield points, safepoints, or memory-model boundaries.

**Rule 13 — Compiler Threads Never Block on Mutator State**  
The compiler works on a frozen snapshot of the IR and PGO data. Mutator updates
after the snapshot are picked up by the next compilation.

**Rule 14 — Epoch-Based Reclamation**  
Old JIT code and IR nodes are reclaimed using epoch-based garbage collection.
When the optimizer replaces a `Node`, the old node is tagged with an epoch.
Once all threads advance past that epoch, the memory is bulk-freed. This avoids
both locks and use-after-free. Generated code must not be reclaimed until no
thread can be executing it or depend on its deopt metadata. IR nodes and
machine code need different reclamation guarantees.

---

## Part IV: The Numbered Rules

### Data Structures & IR Design

**Rule 15 — Index-Based Graph**  
Never use raw pointers (`Node*`) for edges in the Sea of Nodes. All node
references must use a 32-bit integer index:

```cpp
using NodeId = uint32_t;
```

This cuts memory footprint in half, doubles L1/L2 cache capacity, and makes the
IR trivially serializable and immune to pointer invalidation during arena
reallocation.

**Rule 16 — Interned Symbols**  
Never pass, compare, or store `std::string` or `std::string_view` in the IR or
passes. All identifiers, variable names, function names, type names, field
names, module names, and guest-language attribute names must be interned into a
global `SymbolTable` at the frontend. The IR must only use a `SymbolId`
(`uint32_t`).

**Rule 17 — Cache-Friendly Hash Maps**  
`std::unordered_map` and `std::map` are forbidden in the compiler hot path.
For Global Value Numbering, Hash-Consing, and any pass requiring a hash table,
you must use a cache-friendly, open-addressing hash map.

**Rule 18 — Sparse Sets and BitVectors for Pass Data**  
Ban `std::set`, `std::unordered_set`, and `std::vector<bool>` for dataflow
analysis. Passes tracking sets of `NodeId`s, such as liveness, dominators, and
visited sets, must use **Sparse Sets** for small dense sets or **BitVectors**
for large sparse sets.

**Rule 19 — Small Buffer Optimization for Variable-Length Data**  
Ban `std::vector` for data that usually has 1 to 4 elements. For use-def
chains, instruction operands, and basic block predecessors/successors, use a
`SmallVector<T, N>`, where N is typically 2, 3, or 4.

**Rule 20 — Structure of Arrays for Bulk Pass Processing**  
When a pass needs to process a specific field of millions of nodes, do not
iterate over the `Node` structs. Extract that attribute into contiguous
`std::pmr::vector` storage in Structure-of-Arrays layout to allow perfect CPU
prefetching and SIMD vectorization on the compiler’s own passes.

### Performance & Hardware

**Rule 21 — Exploit C++26 Compiler Hints**  
Use `[[likely]]` and `[[unlikely]]` on all PGO-driven branches and
deoptimization traps. Use C++23/26 `[[assume(condition)]]` to tell the
compiler about invariants, for example:

```cpp
[[assume(node_id < graph.size())]];
```

This eliminates bounds checks in internal compiler data structures where safe.

**Rule 22 — Zero-Cost Error Propagation**  
Do not use verbose `if (err)` chains that ruin branch prediction. Use
`std::expected<T, Error>` and monadic operations (`and_then`, `transform`) or
a custom `TRY()` macro that compiles down to a single branch, keeping the hot
path instruction cache pristine.

**Rule 23 — No Hard-Coded Constants in Optimization Logic**  
Magic numbers are forbidden. Every threshold, budget, limit, and heuristic
constant used in any optimization pass MUST be defined as a named, documented
`constexpr` constant or configuration parameter. CI static analysis fails if
numeric literals greater than 2 appear in pass logic without a named constant
reference.

**Rule 24 — No Target-Specific or Guest-Language-Specific Hacks in Generic Passes**  
Mid-level and research passes, such as GVN, LICM, SLP, and alias analysis, MUST
NOT contain target-specific conditionals such as `#ifdef X86`, nor
guest-language-specific conditionals such as `if language == Python`.

All target knowledge must be abstracted behind the `Target` interface and
queried via cost models or capability flags.

All guest-language knowledge must be abstracted behind the Guest Language
Profile, capability flags, effect classes, dependency records, and runtime
hooks.

**Rule 25 — No Heuristics Without Empirical Validation**  
Every heuristic MUST be backed by benchmark data showing measurable
improvement, a mechanism to override/tune it, and documentation explaining why
the value was chosen.

**Rule 26 — No Silent Fallbacks Without Telemetry**  
When the JIT falls back to a lower tier, when a speculative guard fails, or
when regalloc spills excessively, the event MUST be recorded in
telemetry/profile data. Silent fallbacks hide performance problems.

**Rule 27 — No Assumption of Stable Hardware**  
No pass may assume fixed cache line sizes, SIMD widths, or memory latency
ratios. All hardware parameters MUST be queried at runtime for JIT or
build-time for AOT via the `Target` interface.

**Rule 28 — No Optimization Without Measurable Win**  
Every optimization pass added to the pipeline MUST demonstrate a measurable
geometric mean improvement across the benchmark suite, OR enable a
correctness/safety property that cannot be achieved otherwise. Underperforming
passes are removed.

### Correctness & Guest Semantics

**Rule 29 — No FFI Optimization Without ABI Proof**  
FFI/native interop optimizations must prove:

- calling convention correctness
- stack alignment
- register clobbering
- exception propagation
- memory ownership transfer
- guest-runtime state preservation
- reference-management transfer where applicable

**Rule 30 — No Vectorization Without Dependence Proof**  
Vectorization, whether SLP or loop-based, must prove no aliasing, or use
versioned checks, bounds safety, alignment, and correct scalar fallback.

**Rule 31 — No Persistent State Without Versioning**  
Profile caches, code caches, and AOT artifacts must be versioned. A change in
the IR format, DVM bytecode version, Guest Language Profile version, pass
order, target ABI, or runtime configuration invalidates the cache.

**Rule 32 — All Orthogonal Boolean State Must Be Bitmasked**  
Any set of independent boolean properties on a hot-path data structure, such as
`NodeFlags` or `EffectTags`, must be represented as a bitmask with type-safe
`Flags<E>` wrappers. Raw integers are forbidden for flag-like state.

**Rule 33 — No Implicit Conversions or Coercions in IR**  
The DVM IR MUST NOT perform implicit type conversions, integer promotions, or
pointer coercions. All conversions must be explicit nodes. The frontend
lowering pass inserts these explicitly.

Examples:

- `IntToPtr`
- `PtrToInt`
- `SExt`
- `ZExt`
- `Trunc`
- `BitCast`
- `Box`
- `Unbox`
- `NativeToGuestRef`
- `GuestToNativeRef`

### Testing & Verification

**Rule 34 — Five Regression Tests Per Bug Fix**  
Every bug fix must include at least **5 regression tests**:

1. Minimal reproducer.
2. Variant trigger, meaning a different code pattern with the same root cause.
3. Boundary/negative test, ensuring the fix does not over-correct.
4. Integration/contextual test, meaning the bug in realistic surrounding code.
5. Deopt/State Reconstruction test, verifying that if the JIT speculates
   wrongly, the deopt to Tier 0 produces the exact same state.

**Enforcement:** CI fails if a PR labeled `bugfix` has fewer than 5 new test
cases.

**Rule 35 — Golden Tests for Every Pass**  
Every optimization pass must have at least 10 golden IR tests. Checked-in input
and expected IR file pairs must be maintained. Tests must run in both Static
Mode and Profile Mode.

**Rule 36 — Differential Testing is Mandatory in CI**  
Tier 0 Interpreter ↔ Tier 1 JIT ↔ Tier 2 JIT ↔ Tier 3 AOT comparisons run on
every PR for every supported Guest Language Profile. Tier outputs must be
observationally equivalent according to the guest semantic oracle.

Any permitted differences must be explicitly listed, versioned, and tested.
Memory layout is tested separately only where it is a supported guarantee.
Divergence blocks merge.

**Rule 37 — Deopt Paths Must Be Fuzzed Weekly**  
Scheduled CI job. Results triaged within 24 hours. Untriaged deopt fuzz
failures block releases.

**Rule 38 — Replay Logs Retained for All CI Failures**  
Failed test runs automatically save full compile replay artifacts:

- IR snapshot
- PGO profile
- compiler options
- RNG seed
- target description
- Guest Language Profile version
- failure context

Debugging starts from replay, not reproduction.

**Rule 39 — Performance Regressions Require Explicit Waiver**  
If a benchmark regresses beyond the approved threshold, the PR must include
root cause analysis, justification, a tracking issue, and approval. No silent
performance degradation.

**Rule 40 — Graph Verifier Runs in Debug Builds After Every Pass**  
The verifier checks:

- no dangling `NodeId`s
- effect chain continuity
- control dominance
- use-def consistency
- `FrameState` attached to every PGO-driven guard
- dependency metadata completeness
- guest-effect legality

**Rule 41 — Test Names Encode the Bug/Feature They Cover**  
Bad: `test_pea_3`.  
Good: `pea_non_escaping_region_object_with_deopt_materializes_correctly`.

Searchable, self-documenting.

### Speculation & Guarding

**Rule 42 — No Assumption Without Invalidation**  
Every PGO-driven assumption must have:

- a registry entry, called the Watchdog
- an invalidation path, called the Trip
- a fallback to static proof or lower-tier execution

**Rule 43 — No Specialization Without Fallback**  
Every specialized clone, for example a bounds-check-eliminated container loop,
must have:

- a generic fallback
- a deopt path
- a budget limit

**Rule 44 — No Profile Data Without Confidence**  
Profile data must include:

- sample count
- stability
- age
- decay
- variance
- deopt correlation

Low-confidence data must not trigger aggressive speculation.

**Rule 45 — No Aggressive Pass Without a Cost Model**  
Inlining, cloning, unrolling, SLP vectorization, and PEA materialization must
all use a strict cost model based on target hardware latencies and guest
object overhead.

---

## Part V: Code Quality & Developer Velocity Laws

**Rule 46 — Local Pre-Commit Checks Must Complete in < 2 Seconds**  
Strictness must not impede velocity. The local `pre-commit` hook, including
formatting, basic linting, and copyright headers, must execute in under 2
seconds. Heavy checks, including full test suites and differential testing,
are deferred to asynchronous CI.

**Rule 47 — Actionable Compiler Diagnostics**  
The compiler must never output opaque errors such as “Error: something went
wrong”. All `Diagnostic` objects must include:

- the exact source location
- a clear human-readable message
- the expected vs actual state
- a suggested fix

This saves developers hours of debugging.

**Rule 48 — `[[nodiscard]]` on All Result Types**  
All functions returning `std::expected`, `Result`, or `Error` must be marked
`[[nodiscard]]`. Ignoring an error is a compilation failure. This forces
developers to handle edge cases explicitly without requiring verbose,
performance-killing `if` chains.

**Rule 49 — No `#define` Macros for Logic**  
C-style macros for control flow or logic are forbidden. Use `constexpr`
functions, `inline` functions, or templates. Macros are exempt only for header
guards and trivial token pasting. This ensures the debugger can step through
the code and the compiler can inline/optimize it properly.

**Rule 50 — Fast Incremental Builds via Modular CMake**  
The build system must be structured to allow sub-second incremental builds for
single-file changes. Heavy dependencies, such as testing frameworks or optional
backend components, must be isolated. Developers must not wait minutes to test
a single IR pass modification.

**Rule 51 — Automated Refactoring Tools Over Manual Edits**  
When a structural change is required, such as renaming a `NodeKind` or adding
a field to `FrameState`, a scripted refactoring tool must be provided and run
as part of the PR. Manual, error-prone find-and-replace across many files is
forbidden.

**Rule 52 — Self-Contained, Reproducible Test Cases**  
Every test must be fully self-contained. It must not rely on external network
calls, specific local directory structures, or non-deterministic system state.
Tests must run identically on a developer machine, a Linux CI runner, or a
macOS workstation.

---

## Part VI: Anti-Slop & Robustness Laws

**Rule 53 — No “Small Bug” or “Minor Edge Case” Rationalization**  
The phrases “small bug,” “minor edge case,” “rarely happens,” “only affects
cold paths,” and “good enough for now” are banned. In a systems compiler,
“small” bugs cause silent data corruption or catastrophic performance cliffs.
All bugs must be triaged with explicit severity.

**Rule 54 — No Workarounds for Compiler/Runtime Bugs**  
Adding code to “work around” a bug in the compiler, runtime, or standard
library is forbidden. The underlying defect MUST be fixed. Temporary
mitigations require a tracking issue, a removal deadline of two weeks or less,
and explicit approval from the tech lead.

**Rule 55 — No Implicit Knowledge Transfer**  
All design decisions, trade-offs, historical context, and operational knowledge
MUST be captured in persistent, searchable documentation. This includes code
comments, ADRs, wiki pages, and specs. Oral tradition and chat messages are
not valid knowledge stores.

**Rule 56 — No Premature Simplification**  
Do not simplify, abstract, or generalize code until the full problem space is
understood and at least two concrete use cases exist. Premature simplification
creates leaky abstractions that fail under real-world guest-language
conditions.

**Rule 57 — No Copy-Paste Code or Structural Duplication**  
If two code blocks share structure, extract a helper, template, or data-driven
approach. ABI definitions, register lists, and pass boilerplate must use
generators, `constexpr` helpers, or declarative tables.

**Rule 58 — No Silent Fallbacks or Default Returns**  
Switch statements on closed enums must be exhaustive. Non-exhaustive switches
require `[[assume(false)]]` plus `DVM_UNREACHABLE()`. Functions must not
return arbitrary default values such as `return 0;` or `return nullptr;` when
input is invalid.

**Rule 59 — No Lazy Data Structures or Algorithms**  
Use the right tool, not the convenient tool. Linear search is forbidden where
O(1) lookup is feasible. String comparison is forbidden where symbol IDs
suffice.

**Rule 60 — No Untested or Unverified Code Paths**  
Every branch, edge case, and error path must have explicit test coverage. “It
compiles” is not verification. Only automated, reproducible tests count.

**Rule 61 — No Performance-Agnostic Implementation**  
Hot-path code must avoid allocations, exceptions, RTTI, virtual dispatch, and
cache-unfriendly patterns. Performance is a feature. Ignoring it in
implementation guarantees degradation.

**Rule 62 — No Deletion-by-Avoidance**  
Deleting, disabling, commenting out, or stubbing functionality because it is
“too hard” or “too complex” is strictly forbidden. When encountering difficult
problems: Decompose, Research, Prototype, Document, and Escalate.

**Rule 63 — No Fragile Implementations**  
All implementations MUST be resilient to malformed input, concurrent access,
resource exhaustion, and platform/hardware variation. Fragile patterns, such as
implicit ordering dependencies, global mutable state, and unchecked pointer
arithmetic, are forbidden.

**Rule 64 — No Documentation Debt**  
Every public API, internal helper, IR node, pass, configuration knob, and
non-obvious algorithm MUST have documentation at the point of definition
covering:

- Purpose
- Invariants
- Rationale
- Edge Cases
- Cross-References

Stale documentation is treated as a bug with the same severity as stale code.

**Rule 65 — No Easy Fixes — Only Correctness-Preserving Performance Fixes**  
When fixing a bug, you must implement the fix that simultaneously preserves
performance and correctness. “Easy” fixes that sacrifice either property are
forbidden unless explicitly documented as temporary mitigations with tracking
issues and removal deadlines.

**Rule 66 — Slop Detection Checklist**  
Every PR reviewer must verify:

- [ ] No unnamed numeric constants in logic
- [ ] No duplicated code blocks or copy-paste patterns
- [ ] No silent fallbacks or unsafe default returns
- [ ] No prohibited containers in hot paths, such as `std::unordered_map` or
      `std::vector` for small collections
- [ ] All invariants documented and validated
- [ ] No premature abstractions without at least two consumers
- [ ] No untracked workarounds or `HACK` comments
- [ ] No target-specific logic outside `backend/`
- [ ] No guest-language-specific logic outside Guest Language Profile hooks
- [ ] All new code paths have test coverage
- [ ] Hot-path changes justified with profiling/benchmarks
- [ ] Every new guard has a `FrameState` attachment
- [ ] Every speculative node carries metadata:
  - speculation kind
  - PGO/static source
  - confidence
  - guard plan
  - deopt target
  - invalidation dependency
- [ ] Every GC reference in generated code across a safepoint has a stack map
- [ ] Every deopt point is reachable and has complete deopt metadata
- [ ] No raw object pointers held across safepoints without GC map entries
- [ ] No `getenv()` or mutex-locking calls in dispatch loops or hot paths
- [ ] No atomic RMW in per-instruction or per-backedge hot paths unless
      explicitly justified
- [ ] Every memory store of a reference executes the correct write barrier if
      the GC requires one
- [ ] W^X is maintained: no page is simultaneously writable and executable
- [ ] Code publication is atomic with release semantics; consumers acquire

Failure on any item blocks merge. No exceptions. No “small slop.” No “we’ll fix
it later.” Slop is banned.

---

## Part VII: Guest Language Semantic Fidelity Laws

**Rule 67 — The Guest Reference Implementation Is the Semantic Oracle**  
For each supported guest language, all executable behavior must match the
supported reference semantics unless a divergence is explicitly documented,
justified, versioned, and approved.

Observable behavior includes at least:

- program output
- exceptions and stack traces
- side effects
- object mutation
- weak-reference behavior where supported
- finalization behavior where supported
- frame introspection
- debugging and monitoring events
- object identity semantics where supported
- module/import semantics
- documented builtin/runtime library behavior

Any unapproved divergence is a correctness bug.

Enforcement includes the guest reference test suite, differential Tier
0/1/2/3 runs, and guest-specific semantic tests.

**Rule 68 — Observable Effects Must Not Be Reordered, Duplicated, or Deleted**  
No optimization may delete, duplicate, hoist, sink, merge, or reorder
guest-visible effects unless the effect system proves semantic equivalence.

Guest-visible effects include, where applicable:

- field/member reads and writes

- environment variables
- time
- randomness
- locale
- filesystem state
- import state
- global/module mutation
- builtin/runtime mutation
- object layout
- GC state
- reference-management state where observable

- monkey patching
- builtin/runtime shadowing
- module reloading where supported
- tracing/profiling hooks
- monitoring hooks
- weak references
- finalizers
- GC/memory introspection

If a dynamic feature cannot be optimized safely, the system must deoptimize or
disable JIT for the affected scope. It must never silently produce wrong
introspection or semantics.

Enforcement includes dynamic-feature test matrices, deopt tests, and guest API
tests.

**Rule 71 — Specialization Requires Versioned, Invalidatable Dependencies**  
Every specialization assumption must record a dependency on a versioned entity.

Examples include:

- object shape/version
- class/type version
- module version
- global dictionary/version
- builtin/runtime library version
- function/code object version
- method resolution order version
- descriptor/property version
- container key/layout version
- signature version
- import state version
- bytecode version
- Guest Language Profile version
- profile version

If any dependency changes, all dependent compiled code must be invalidated or
guarded.

Enforcement includes dependency graph tests, invalidation fuzzing, and inline
cache tests.

**Rule 72 — Guest Numeric Semantics Must Be Preserved Exactly**  
Numeric specializations must preserve the guest language’s numeric semantics.

Depending on the guest language, this may include:

- arbitrary precision integers
- integer overflow behavior
- bool/int relationship where applicable
- float NaN behavior
- negative zero
- float/int conversion rules
- overflow errors
- division-by-zero errors
- complex number semantics
- operator fallback to overloaded methods
- subclass overrides
- wrapping/saturating/trapping integer modes where defined

Fast-math-style optimizations are forbidden unless explicitly scoped, proven
safe, and disabled by default.

Enforcement includes numeric differential tests, overflow tests, NaN tests, and
operator override tests.

**Rule 73 — Escape Analysis Must Not Eliminate Observable Objects**  
Objects may be scalarized or eliminated only if they cannot be observed by:

- identity operators
- address observation where supported
- weak references
- finalizers
- GC introspection
- reference-count introspection
- exception stack traces
- frame locals
- profiling/debugging hooks
- user code escaping
- dynamic introspection
- native/FFI calls
- monitoring events

If any escape path exists, the object must be materialized.

Enforcement includes escape-analysis verifier rules, materialization tests, and
deopt tests.

**Rule 74 — Guest Exceptions Are Control-Flow Values, Not Native Exceptions**  
Guest exceptions must be represented as runtime values and control-flow edges.
Native C++ exceptions must not be used to implement guest exception
propagation.

The JIT must preserve, where supported by the guest language:

- exception type
- exception value
- stack trace
- exception chaining
- exception context
- exception notes
- exception state introspection
- source positions
- frame association
- finally-block semantics
- scope-exit cleanup semantics

Enforcement includes exception semantic tests and stack-trace golden tests.

**Rule 75 — Frames Must Be Reconstructible on Demand**  
If the JIT inlines, merges, elides, or optimizes frames, it must be able to
materialize a semantically correct guest frame when required by:

- stack traces
- exceptions
- debuggers
- frame introspection
- reflection APIs
- locals access
- tracing/profiling
- deoptimization
- monitoring hooks
- user introspection

`FrameState` must be sufficient to reconstruct:

- bytecode offset
- source position
- locals
- closure cells
- free variables
- global/module version
- builtin/runtime version
- exception state
- tracing state
- monitoring state
- suspension state where applicable

Enforcement includes frame materialization tests, deopt tests, and debugger
tests.

**Rule 76 — Generators, Coroutines, Async, and Other Suspension Constructs Must Be JIT-Safe**  
Suspension points are semantic boundaries.

The JIT must correctly handle, where supported by the guest language:

- yield/resume
- await/resume
- throw into resumable functions
- close/cancel semantics
- completion exceptions
- cancellation exceptions
- exception propagation across suspension
- frame reconstruction after suspension
- local state after resume
- finalization of unresumed objects

Suspension points must be valid deopt/safepoint candidates.

Enforcement includes suspension stress tests and deopt-at-yield or
deopt-at-await style tests.

**Rule 77 — Debugging, Tracing, Profiling, and Monitoring Must Remain Correct**  
The JIT must not break guest-language tooling.

Supported tooling may include:

- tracers
- profilers
- debuggers
- breakpoints
- line events
- call events
- return events
- exception events
- instruction-level events
- monitoring hooks

When tooling is active, the JIT must either:

- emit correct events with correct semantics,
- run unoptimized lower-tier code,
- or fall back to Tier 0.

Missing events, duplicate events, wrong source positions, or wrong exception
events are correctness bugs.

Enforcement includes tracing/profiling differential tests.

**Rule 78 — Object Identity and Reference-Management Semantics Must Be Explicit**  
If a guest language exposes reference counts, handles, ownership, or identity
addresses, DVM must either preserve those semantics or explicitly disable the
observable feature.

If using a moving GC:

- object identity semantics must remain correct
- moving objects must not expose unstable addresses to guest code
- pinned objects must be used where address identity is observable
- handles or stable identity mechanisms must be provided

No optimization may assume that object addresses are stable unless the object
model explicitly pins the object.

Enforcement includes identity tests, weak-reference tests, and GC tests.

**Rule 79 — No Assumptions About Hashes, Randomness, or Addresses**  
The compiler must not persist or bake assumptions about:

- hash values
- hash seeds
- container iteration order beyond language guarantees
- ASLR addresses
- object addresses
- code addresses
- randomized runtime values
- nondeterministic allocation order

Persistent artifacts must not contain address-dependent assumptions unless
explicitly relocated and validated at load time.

Enforcement includes hash-randomization CI, ASLR replay tests, and persistent
artifact validation.

**Rule 80 — Static Typing Is Not Runtime Proof Unless Certified**  
Type hints, final annotations, static blocks, or annotations do not by
themselves justify unsafe optimization.

Static proofs must be based on:

- sealed types
- finality guarantees
- module isolation
- absence of dynamic mutation
- verified ABI constraints
- verified import boundaries
- absence of introspection/monkey patching
- mechanically checked proof artifacts

If static proof cannot be maintained, the code must use guards or fall back.

Enforcement includes static-mode verifier rules and negative mutation tests.

## Part VIII: Deoptimization and GC Integration Laws

**Rule 81 — Deoptimization Metadata Is a Required Compilation Output**  
A compilation is not complete until it has produced:

- deopt points
- `FrameState` snapshots
- stack maps
- GC reference maps
- live range information
- materialization plan
- interpreter re-entry information
- dependency list
- guard metadata
- exception-state reconstruction info

If deopt metadata cannot be generated, the compilation must fail and fall back.

Enforcement includes compiler verifier rules and missing-deopt compile-fail
tests.

**Rule 82 — FrameState Must Be Complete and Machine-Checkable**  
`FrameState` must describe enough information to reconstruct the exact
lower-tier state.

It must include, as applicable:

- bytecode offset/instruction position
- register-to-interpreter slot mapping
- stack slot types
- object references
- primitive values
- constants
- closure cells
- free variables
- global/module version
- builtin/runtime version
- exception state
- tracing/monitoring state
- suspension state
- materialized object graph
- reference-management state

The verifier must reject incomplete `FrameState`.

Enforcement includes `FrameState` verifier rules and forced-deopt tests.

**Rule 83 — Guard Failure Must Produce Exact Lower-Tier State**  
When a guard fails, the runtime must resume in a state observationally
indistinguishable from the state the lower tier would have reached at that
point.

This includes:

- local variables
- stack state
- exception state
- side effects already committed
- reference-management state
- frame visibility
- source position
- monitoring/tracing state
- object materialization state

If exact reconstruction is impossible, the speculation must be rejected at
compile time.

Enforcement includes differential deopt tests and forced-guard-failure
fuzzing.

**Rule 84 — Deopt Loops Must Be Detected and Throttled**  
Repeated deoptimization at the same site is a performance and correctness
hazard.

The runtime must track:

- deopt count per site
- deopt count per function
- deopt reason
- time window
- tier history

If thresholds are exceeded, the system must:

- disable the failing speculation
- recompile with weaker assumptions
- downgrade tier
- blacklist the function temporarily or permanently
- emit telemetry

Enforcement includes deopt-loop regression tests and telemetry validation.

**Rule 85 — Speculative Side Effects Must Be Reversible or Deferred**  
Speculative optimization must not commit irreversible guest-visible side
effects before the speculation is proven.

If an effect cannot be proven safe:

- defer it
- guard before it
- materialize fallback state
- or do not perform the optimization

Memory stores that may be observed by guest code, native code, finalizers,
weak references, or debugging tools are not freely rollback-able.

Enforcement includes effect-system audits and speculative-store tests.

**Rule 86 — All GC References in JIT Code Must Be Tracked**  
Generated code must not hold raw object pointers in registers, stack slots, or
embedded constants across safepoints unless those references are recorded in GC
maps.

Rules:

- every reference register across a call/safepoint must be in a stack map
- every reference spill must be visible to GC
- embedded object pointers must use handles or be otherwise tracked
- object references must not be hidden in untracked integer registers unless
  explicitly tagged and supported

Enforcement includes GC map verifier rules and GC stress tests.

**Rule 87 — Read and Write Barriers Must Be Correct**  
If the GC requires write barriers, every store of a reference in generated code
must execute the correct barrier.

If the GC requires read barriers, load barriers, or forwarding checks, every
relevant reference load must execute them.

Missing barriers are blocker bugs.

Enforcement includes barrier verifier rules, GC stress, and moving-GC tests.

**Rule 88 — Generated Code Must Poll Safepoints**  
JIT code must include safepoint polls at:

- loop backedges
- function calls
- allocation sites
- long native transitions where specified
- OSR entry/exit points
- tier transition points
- invalidation points where required

Safepoint latency must be bounded.

Enforcement includes safepoint stress tests and GC pause tests.

**Rule 89 — All JIT Frames Must Be Walkable**  
Every JIT frame must be walkable by:

- stack map
- deopt info
- callee-saved register locations
- guest frame association
- native/managed transition markers

Enforcement includes stack-walking tests and GC/deopt/profiler integration
tests.

**Rule 90 — Stack Overflow and Recursion Limits Must Be Checked**  
JIT code must respect guest recursion limits and native stack limits.

Checks must occur:

- before entering JIT frames
- before inlined calls
- before recursive calls
- before OSR entry where applicable
- before native transitions where stack usage changes

Failure must produce the correct guest exception, not a crash.

Enforcement includes recursion-limit tests and stack-overflow tests.

**Rule 91 — Allocation Fast Paths Must Handle Failure Safely**  
Allocation fast paths may optimize the common case, but slow paths must handle:

- heap exhaustion
- memory allocation failure
- GC pressure
- object finalization hooks
- allocation callbacks where specified
- guest-language memory error semantics

Generated code must not abort the VM on allocation failure unless the VM is in
an unrecoverable state defined by the runtime spec.

Enforcement includes low-memory tests and allocation-failure injection.

**Rule 92 — Runtime Call Transitions Must Preserve ABI and Runtime State**  
Calls from JIT code into runtime helpers must preserve:

- calling convention
- stack alignment
- callee-saved registers
- GC state
- exception state
- thread state
- guest runtime state
- floating-point/vector register state as required

Runtime helpers must not assume JIT register contents beyond ABI.

Enforcement includes ABI tests and register-clobber tests.

**Rule 93 — Native Interop and FFI Are Opaque Unless Proven**  
Calls into native extensions or foreign functions are opaque barriers unless a
formal ABI/effect proof exists.

Assume native calls may:

- mutate arbitrary guest state
- call back into guest code
- allocate
- raise guest exceptions
- change types/modules/globals
- invalidate specialization assumptions
- acquire/release runtime locks
- trigger GC
- observe object layout
- corrupt assumptions if misused

Optimizations across FFI boundaries require explicit proof and invalidation
rules.

Enforcement includes FFI barrier tests and native callback mutation tests.

**Rule 94 — Weak References, Finalizers, and GC Callbacks Must See Valid State**  
JIT code must not leave weak references, finalizers, or GC callbacks in states
where they observe:

- partially initialized objects
- invalid forwarding pointers
- untracked references
- missing barriers
- stale object headers
- inconsistent reference counts
- objects that should have been materialized but were not

Enforcement includes weakref/finalizer stress tests.

**Rule 95 — Object Shape and Type Mutation Must Invalidate Specialized Code**  
Any change to assumptions used by inline caches or specialization must
invalidate dependent code.

This includes, where supported:

- class/type attribute changes
- instance layout changes
- slots/property changes
- metaclass/metatype changes
- method redefinition
- property replacement
- descriptor replacement
- method resolution order changes
- builtin/runtime shadowing
- global rebinding
- module dictionary mutation
- code object replacement

Enforcement includes mutation-after-JIT tests.

**Rule 96 — Tier 0 Is the Universal Correctness Fallback**  
Every executable guest function must be runnable in Tier 0. No feature may be
“JIT-only” unless explicitly part of a documented static mode.

If Tier 1/2/3 cannot compile, patch, deopt, or execute code correctly,
execution must fall back to Tier 0.

Enforcement includes fallback tests and JIT-disable tests.

---

## Part IX: Code Cache, Patching, and Security Laws

**Rule 97 — Executable Memory Must Be W^X**  
JIT memory pages must never be simultaneously writable and executable.

Code generation and patching must use one of:

- write-then-execute with protection changes

- platform-approved JIT memory mechanisms

Enforcement includes memory-protection tests and OS-specific audits.

**Rule 98 — Code Publication Must Be Atomic**  
Function entry points, OSR entry points, trampolines, and metadata pointers
must be published atomically.

No thread may observe:

**Rule 102 — Generated Code Must Be Constrained**  
Generated code must only call approved runtime entrypoints and must not
directly:

- write outside its own frame/runtime-approved memory
- execute arbitrary user-provided machine code
- load arbitrary dynamic libraries unless approved
- bypass sandbox/security policy

Enforcement includes codegen allowlists, backend audits, and security tests.

Enforcement includes platform security matrix tests.

**Rule 104 — JIT Spraying Defenses Are Required**  
The JIT must not turn attacker-controlled data into executable instruction
streams without mitigation.

Mitigations may include:

- constant blinding
- avoiding embedding uncontrolled immediate sequences
- separating executable code from embedded data
- limiting executable constant islands
- code cache entropy/randomization where appropriate
- validating inputs that influence codegen

Enforcement includes security review and exploit PoC tests.

**Rule 105 — Profiles, Bytecode, and AOT Artifacts Are Untrusted**  
Profile data, serialized IR, AOT artifacts, caches, and bytecode inputs must be
validated before use.

Malformed inputs must not cause:

- undefined behavior
- memory corruption
- arbitrary code execution
- VM crashes
- silent miscompilation

Invalid artifacts must be rejected or ignored with telemetry.

Enforcement includes artifact fuzzing and schema validation.

**Rule 106 — Code Cache Pressure Must Be Managed**  
The code cache must have explicit budgets and eviction policies.

The system must monitor:

- total code size
- metadata size
- dependency graph size
- number of live compiled functions
- number of invalidated functions

When pressure exceeds budgets, the system must throttle compilation, evict cold
code, or fall back.

On mismatch, the artifact must be rejected. Silent loading of incompatible
artifacts is forbidden.

Enforcement includes stale/corrupt AOT artifact tests.

## Part X: Concurrency, Compilation Scheduling, and Tiering Laws

**Rule 109 — Compiler, Runtime, and GC Shared State Must Be Race-Free**  
All shared state accessed by mutator threads, compiler threads, GC threads, and
background services must be synchronized using documented atomic/locking
protocols. TSAN-clean is mandatory for supported concurrent tests.

Enforcement includes TSAN CI and concurrency stress tests.

**Rule 110 — Function Pointer Swaps Must Be Safe and Reversible**  
Installing new code must:

- use atomic publication
- preserve old code until safe
- avoid torn calls
- avoid invalidating metadata still needed by running threads
- support rollback where possible

Function installation must be testable independently of compilation.

Enforcement includes concurrent install/uninstall tests.

**Rule 111 — Safepoint Latency Must Be Bounded**  
Threads must be able to reach a safepoint within a documented bounded time.
Long-running generated loops must contain polls. Native helpers that run for
long durations must cooperate with suspension protocols.

Enforcement includes GC pause tests and suspension stress tests.

**Rule 112 — Compilation Latency and Memory Budgets Must Be Defined**  
Each tier must have explicit budgets:

- Tier 1 compile latency
- Tier 2 compile latency
- Tier 2 memory usage
- Tier 3 AOT compile time where relevant
- IR memory usage
- pass fixpoint iteration limits
- code size limits
- deopt metadata limits

Budget violations must trigger fallback or cancellation, not mutator stalls.

Enforcement includes compile-budget benchmarks.

**Rule 113 — Compilations Must Be Cancellable**  
If a function is invalidated while compiling, the compiler must be able to
cancel or discard the result without leaking memory or installing stale code.

Enforcement includes invalidation-during-compilation tests.

**Rule 114 — Hotness Counters Must Be Robust**  
Profiling counters must be:

- thread-safe or explicitly racy-with-bounded-error
- saturating or overflow-safe

Undefined behavior from counter overflow is forbidden.

Enforcement includes counter fuzzing and long-run soak tests.

**Rule 115 — Recompilation Must Be Throttled**  
Repeated compilation of the same function must be limited by:

No function may cause unbounded compile churn.

Enforcement includes recompile-thrash tests.

**Rule 116 — OSR Entry and Exit Must Be Semantically Exact**  
On-stack replacement must preserve exact guest program state at OSR entry and
exit.

OSR must handle:

- loop induction variables
- iterator state
- exception state

- locals
- stack values
- suspension state if supported
- deopt from OSR code back to interpreter

Enforcement includes OSR state reconstruction tests.

**Rule 117 — Invalidation Must Be Ordered and Visible**  
Invalidation of dependencies must be visible before new assumptions are relied
upon.

The system must avoid:

- executing stale code after invalidation beyond allowed grace
- installing code based on already-invalid dependencies
- racing invalidation with installation

Enforcement includes invalidation race tests.

**Rule 118 — No Global Locks on Hot Runtime Paths**  
Global locks are forbidden in hot runtime paths unless explicitly approved and
budgeted.

Hot paths include:

- deopt to lower tier
- code invalidation
- blacklist events
- fallback events
- recompilation events

Telemetry must include reasons and counters.

Enforcement includes telemetry schema tests.

**Rule 120 — Compiler Bugs Must Not Crash User Programs**  
A compiler failure should degrade performance, not terminate the application.

Compiler/runtime JIT bugs should result in:

- fallback
- disabled optimization
- diagnostic log

Process aborts are only acceptable for unrecoverable VM corruption and must be
treated as P0 bugs.

Enforcement includes fault-injection tests.

---

Passes that cannot satisfy their contract must fail safely.

Enforcement includes pass registry and contract tests.

**Rule 124 — Compilation Must Be Deterministic and Replayable**  
Given the same source/bytecode, compiler version, flags, profile snapshot,
target description, RNG seed, Guest Language Profile, and feature
configuration, compilation must produce deterministic IR and code selection,
except for explicitly documented nondeterminism.

Nondeterminism sources must be logged.

Enforcement includes deterministic replay tests.

**Rule 125 — Passes Must Not Use Hidden Global Mutable State**  
Hot-path passes must not depend on hidden global mutable state.

Allowed global state:

be disabled.

Enforcement includes proof-verifier tests.

**Rule 132 — Every Optimization Must Have a Kill Switch**  
Every nontrivial optimization should be disableable by:

- compiler flag
- environment variable
- configuration knob
- runtime feature gate

**Rule 136 — GC and Deopt Stress Tests Must Be First-Class**  
Dedicated stress modes must:

- force frequent GC
- force moving GC where applicable
- force allocation failure
- force guard failure
- force deopt at every supported point
- force weakref/finalizer activity where supported
- force code invalidation under load

Enforcement includes nightly stress and release gating.

**Rule 137 — Code Installation and Patching Must Be Concurrency-Tested**  
CI must test:

- installing code while executing old code
- invalidating code while running
- patching under load
- retiring code under load
- OSR entry during invalidation
- deopt during patching

Enforcement includes concurrency stress tests.

**Rule 138 — Performance Gates Must Measure More Than Throughput**  
Performance CI must measure:

- startup time
- warmup time
- peak throughput
- tail latency
- compile latency p50/p99
- deopt rate
- guard overhead
- code size
- memory usage
- GC pause impact
- compile CPU cost
- memory pressure
- tier transition counts

A regression in any critical dimension requires waiver.

Enforcement includes benchmark suite with thresholds.

**Rule 139 — Telemetry Must Be Structured, Stable, and Privacy-Safe**  
Telemetry must record:

- compile attempts
- compile failures
- fallback reasons
- guard failures
- deopt reasons
- invalidations
- code cache pressure
- budget violations
- blacklist events
- performance counters

Telemetry must not include source code, user data, or secrets unless explicitly
opted in.

Enforcement includes schema validation and privacy review.

**Rule 140 — Replay Artifacts Must Be Sufficient for Debugging**  
A failed compilation or deopt event should be replayable from:

- source/bytecode hash
- IR snapshot
- pass pipeline state
- profile snapshot
- compiler flags
- target description
- RNG seed
- runtime config
- Guest Language Profile version
- dependency versions
- failure location

Debugging should start from replay, not anecdote.

Enforcement includes replay artifact tests.

**Rule 141 — ABI and FFI Must Have Dedicated Tests**  
Dedicated tests must cover:

- guest → native calls
- native → guest callbacks
- register clobbering
- stack alignment
- exception propagation through FFI
- global runtime lock or free-threading interactions where relevant
- reference ownership transfer
- struct passing where supported
- varargs/keyword conventions where supported
- error return conventions

Enforcement includes ABI test suite.

**Rule 142 — Security Tests Must Be Part of CI**  
Security checks should include:

- W^X scans
- executable memory accounting
- JIT spraying PoCs
- malformed artifact loading
- code-cache exhaustion
- patch race attempts
- sandbox escape tests where applicable
- dependency vulnerability scans

Enforcement includes security CI lane.

**Rule 143 — Guest Language Compatibility Must Be Tracked Explicitly**  
The project must maintain, for each guest language:

- supported language version range
- supported standard-library subset
- known divergences
- unsupported features
- test suite pass requirements
- allowed failure list with owners and expiry dates

Enforcement includes compatibility dashboard.

**Rule 144 — All Major Optimizations Must Be Feature-Gated**  
Every major optimization must be capable of being disabled independently for
bisection and emergency response.

Examples:

- inlining
- PEA
- SLP
- LICM
- GVN
- effect reordering
- inline-cache specialization
- type specialization
- unrolling
- OSR
- Tier 2 compilation
- Tier 3 AOT loading

Enforcement includes flag matrix test.

**Rule 145 — Exceptions to Rules Require an Exception Register**  
No rule may be silently bypassed. Exceptions must include:

- rule ID
- reason
- owner
- risk assessment
- mitigation
- telemetry
- expiry date
- tech lead approval

Expired exceptions automatically become release blockers.

Enforcement includes exception register.

**Rule 146 — Every Rule Must Have Enforcement Metadata**  
Each rule in this document must specify:

- enforcement mechanism
- owner
- severity
- test coverage
- waiver policy

Rules without enforcement should be moved to guidelines or given an enforcement
plan.

Enforcement includes rule metadata lint.

**Rule 147 — Maintain a Compliance Matrix**  
The repository must maintain a mapping from each rule to:

- CI check
- test suite
- verifier
- review checklist
- documentation
- owner

This matrix must be reviewed each release.

Enforcement includes release checklist.

**Rule 148 — Architectural Decisions Require ADRs**  
Any significant compiler/runtime decision must have an Architecture Decision
Record. ADRs must cover:

- context
- options considered
- decision
- consequences
- performance impact
- correctness impact
- security impact
- rollback plan

Enforcement includes PR template requirement.

**Rule 149 — Builds Must Be Hermetic and Dependencies Must Be Pinned**  
Compiler/runtime builds must be reproducible.

Requirements:

- pinned dependencies
- locked toolchains where practical
- no network access during tests
- reproducible artifact hashes
- supply-chain review for new dependencies

Enforcement includes build reproducibility tests.

**Rule 150 — Stale Documentation Is a Defect**  
Documentation must be updated in the same PR as behavior changes.

This includes:

- rules doc
- IR spec
- effect system spec
- ABI spec
- bytecode spec
- Guest Language Profile docs
- pass documentation
- runtime documentation
- telemetry schema
- compatibility matrix

Stale docs are treated like stale code.

Enforcement includes docs lint and PR checklist.

## Part XIII: Definitions

**DVM:**  
Dynamic Virtual Machine. The multi-language compiler/runtime system governed by
this specification.

**Guest language:**  
A language targeting DVM through DVM Portable Bytecode and a Guest Language
Profile.

**Guest Language Profile:**  
A versioned description of a guest language’s semantics, capabilities, object
model, memory model, exception model, and runtime contracts.

**Guest Semantic Oracle:**  
The reference implementation, reference test suite, or formal behavioral model
used to validate guest-language semantic fidelity.

**Hot path:**  
Compiler pass execution, guard execution, inline-cache fast paths, allocation
fast paths, deopt entry trampolines, and dispatch loops. Not deopt
materialization, which may allocate under budget.

**Guard:**  
A runtime mechanism that validates a speculative assumption. May be a hardware
branch, shape/version check, patchpoint, trap, dependency invalidation, or
hardware check.

**FrameState:**  
A snapshot attached to a speculative node that allows the deoptimizer to
reconstruct the exact lower-tier execution state.

**Deopt:**  
The process of transferring execution from a higher tier to a lower tier,
typically Tier 0, while preserving observable program state.

**Safe point:**  
A point in generated code where the thread can safely pause for GC, deopt, or
suspension. Must have bounded latency.

**Observable behavior:**  
Program output, exceptions, side effects, object mutation, weak-reference
behavior, finalization, frame introspection, and monitoring events, as defined
by the Guest Language Profile.

**Effect:**  
A guest-visible operation that cannot be freely reordered, deleted, or
duplicated without semantic proof.

**Dependency:**  
A versioned entity that a specialization relies on. If the dependency changes,
the specialization must be invalidated or guarded.

**Code installation:**  
The atomic publication of a compiled function’s entry point, metadata, and
deopt info.

**Quiescence:**  
A state where no thread is executing old code or depending on old metadata,
allowing safe reclamation.

**Speculation:**  
An optimization that assumes a runtime property holds, guarded by a mechanism
that triggers deopt on failure.

**Static proof:**  
A mechanically-checked artifact demonstrating that a property holds without
runtime guards.

**Profile confidence:**  
A metric combining sample count, stability, age, decay, variance, and deopt
correlation. Low-confidence data must not trigger aggressive speculation.

**Tier transition:**  
A change in execution tier, including Tier 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 or deopt to a lower
tier. Must be observable and recorded.

**Fallback:**  
Graceful degradation to a lower tier or disabled optimization when compilation
or speculation fails.

**Kill switch:**  
A mechanism to disable a specific optimization for bisection and incident
response.

## Part XV: Rule Severity and Waiver Process

**Severity levels:**

- **P0 (Blocker):** Silent data corruption, security vulnerabilities, crashes on
  valid input. Blocks release.
- **P1 (Critical):** Wrong results, missing deopt metadata, GC unsafety. Blocks
  merge to main.
- **P2 (Major):** Performance regressions beyond threshold, missing tests,
  documentation debt. Requires waiver with expiry.
- **P3 (Minor):** Style, naming, minor optimizations. Tracked but non-blocking.

**Waiver process:**

1. File an exception in the exception register.
2. Include:
   - rule ID
   - reason
   - owner
   - risk assessment
   - mitigation
   - telemetry
   - expiry date
   - tech lead approval
3. Waivers auto-expire. Expired waivers become release blockers.
4. No rule may be silently bypassed — silent bypass is itself a Rule 145
   violation.

## Part XVI: Compliance Matrix

The full compliance matrix, mapping Rule → CI check, test suite, owner, is
maintained in `docs/compliance_matrix.md` and reviewed each release.

Example entries:

| Rule | Enforcement | Test Suite | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | IR verifier | guard_tests | compiler team | Every PGO decision needs a guard |
| 24 | static analysis + review | pass_tests | compiler team | No target/language hacks in generic passes |
| 67 | differential CI | guest_compat | runtime team | Guest reference oracle is authoritative |
| 86 | GC map verifier | gc_stress | GC team | No untracked refs across safepoints |
| 97 | OS memory tests | security_ci | security team | W^X mandatory |
